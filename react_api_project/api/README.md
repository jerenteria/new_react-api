# Hello and welcome to my app!
Building this app I wanted to learn how to make a search box that allowed users to filter through a list. 
Getting the filter to work properly was the hardest part. I tried multiple functions but was not able to get it right. 
After looking through various examples I finally found one that made the most sense to me and it got my app running!
